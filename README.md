# Natural Language Processing for Restaurants

## Overview
Enhance your understanding of customer feedback with our machine learning project focused on restaurant reviews. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project analyzes reviews to extract meaningful insights, helping restaurateurs improve service and customer satisfaction.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment behind each reviewâ€”positive, neutral, or negative.
- **Data Handling**: Process and analyze data from the included `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv` file.

## Project Structure
- **Restaurant_Reviews.tsv**: A tab-separated file containing sample restaurant reviews.
- **natural_language_processing.py**: Python script for processing and analyzing restaurant reviews using NLP techniques.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meshalalsultan/natural_language_processing-for-resturants.git
    ```
2. **Set up your environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python natural_language_processing.py
    ```

## How It Works
The script reads reviews from the `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`, performs preprocessing and sentiment analysis, and outputs the sentiment score for each review, helping you gauge overall customer sentiment.
